    "- Various versions\n",
    "  - Issue 01 (Completed) Replace \"itg_integrated_plot\" with a simpler function, as used in the Washington seminar. Initially write a compatibility bridge.\n",
    "  - Issue 06 (Completed) Remove unnecessary libraries\n",
    "  - Issue 07 (Completed) In all analysis notebooks, TRAIN_PREF and ANALYSIS_PREF are identical to TRAIN_ID, so it can be removed / substituted.\n",
    "  - **Issue 08** In all training and analysis notebooks, DATA_ID and TRAIN_ID should be brought to the top, so that we do not need to hunt them in the code.\n",
    "  - ***Issue 09*** (Partial) As trainig will eventually be done in batch, remove all unnecessary charts from training notebooks, those needed (such as history of objective function) plot directly to file.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**QTSA 04 QNN**\n",

    "  - V9.6-7 Split training and analysis\n",
    "    - **Issue 02** Model parameter \"input\" not saved in \"info.json\" after training, which requires an explicit loading of data before hand and calculating it from windows length.\n",
    "    - <font color=\"red\">Issue 05</font> (Completed) Function \"swindow_qnn_model\" has a mispelled variables qubit_no/qubits_no \"qtsa_04_qnn_v9.6_train\" notebook. However, it seemed to work as the outside context defined the missing variable. It was addressed in the \"qtsa_04_qnn_v9.6_analysis\" notebook but has to be fixed in the training part as well - it was left in there to ensure replication of results, we will need to test if after correction it produces identical or close results. **Fix**: Function \"swindow_qnn_model\" corrected in both training and analysis, tests completed, new results provide similar / better results.\n",
    "  - V9.8 Error corrections / new results\n",
    "    - Also renamed the model identifier from \"qnn\" to \"xqnn\" to reflect the last model's changes to make it extensible in terms of the qubit numbers beyond the number of inputs.\n",

    "    - **Issue 03** Model parameter \"ent\" not saved in \"info.json\" after training, which requires an assumption as to what is the type of entanglement block in the circuit.\n",
    "    - **Issue 04** Model parameter \"ilayers\" not saved in \"info.json\" after training, which requires its extraction from TRAIN_ID as per file name.\n",
