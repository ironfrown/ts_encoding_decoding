# Time series encoding and decoding
A Qiskit repository for the QTML'2024 poster:
- Jacob L. Cybulski and Sebastian ZajÄ…c (2024, "The Art of Data Encoding and Decoding for Quantum Time Series Analysis."
  *8th International Conference on Quantum Techniques in Machine Learning,* University of Melbourne,
  Melbourne, Australia, 25-29 November 2024.

## Folders
- **log_2:** repository of files generated by notebooks
- **utils:** various utilities, many obsolete
- **runs:** archive of important runs from the past 
- **legacy:** obsolete files, not included

## Included notebooks
- **<font color="red">ts_qiskit_versions_and_issues.ipynb:</font>**<br/>List of versions and unresolved issues/bugs
- **qtsa_00_data_v1.0_2sin.ipynb:**<br/>Generates simple TS for PQFT models
- **qtsa_00_data_v1.0_2sin_sw.ipynb:**<br/>Generates TS for SW models
- **qtsa_02_serial_pqft_vXXX_train/analysis_comment.ipynb:**<br/>Trains and analyses PQFT serial (1 qubit) model
- **qtsa_03_parallel_pqft_vXXX_train/analysis_comment.ipynb:**<br/>Trains and analyses PQFT parallel (multi-qubit) model
- **qtsa_04_xqnn_vXXX_train/analysis_comment.ipynb:**<br/>Trains and analyses an extended SW QNN model
- **qtsa_05_swind_vXXX_train/analysis_comment.ipynb:**<br/>Trains and analyses SW QTSA model
- **qtsa_06_cnn_vXXX_train/analysis_comment.ipynb: Classic MPL:**<br/>Trains and analyses classical NN (MLP)

## Utilities
All utilities have been included in the folder "utils":
- **Charts.py:** Functions producing various types of charts
- **Cost.py:** A Qiskit regressor class, which includes a callback used in model training
- **Files.py:** Functions reading and writing from and to different files types
- **Metrics.py:** Functions calculating scoring metrics on dictionaries and time series
- **Target.py:** Functions geberating different types of data for training and testing
- **Tools.py:** Some odd functions that have not been put into a better place
- **TS.py:** Functions manipulating time-series, not used in this repo (I think)
- **Window.py:** Functions managing time-series split into sliding windows 

## Typical process (data - train - analysis)
A typical process is to:
- Generate data for model training and save it in **log/data/sub-dir** folder,<br/>
  examples "qtsa_00_data_v1.0_2sin.ipynb" and "qtsa_00_data_v1.0_2sin_sw.ipynb"
- Create a model, train using a selected data set from **log/data/sub-dir** folder (point to it as *DATA_ID*),<br/>
  then save the history of cost in **log/training/sub-dir** and parameters in **log/params/sub-dir**,<br/>
  example "qtsa_02_serial_pqft_v8.16_train_lay27_lbfgsb_ep39.ipynb"
- Analyse cost and evolving models (defined by parameters) from **log/training/sub-dir** (point to it as *TRAIN_ID*),<br/>
  then save charts in *log/figures/sub-dir* and analysis results in **log/analysis/sub-dir**,<br/>
  example "qtsa_03_parallel_pqft_v8.16_analysis_q5_lbfgsb_ep50.ipynb"
